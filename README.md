## Features

- Scans and analyzes price data to identify harmonic patterns
- Detects patterns based on predefined logic
- Calculates optimal entry points for trading
- Sets appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels for each trade
- Displays the identified patterns, entry points, stop-losses, and take-profits
- Allows customization of settings such as timeframes, currency pairs, and pattern parameters
- Optimizes code to minimize resource usage
- Handles errors and displays error messages or notifications

## How it Works

1. The code includes necessary libraries and functions for trading, series manipulation, and array operations.
2. Constants are defined, including the maximum number of patterns to be detected, buffers for entry points, stop-loss calculation, and take-profit calculation.
3. Global variables are declared, including a trading object, a series object, and an array to store detected harmonic patterns.
4. The code defines a function `ScanAndAnalyzePatterns()` to scan and analyze price data for harmonic patterns.
   - Previously detected patterns are cleared.
   - Variables for pattern detection are initialized.
   - A loop iterates through the price data to identify patterns.
   - If a pattern is detected, the pattern points are stored in an array.
   - Detected patterns are stored in the global array.
5. The code defines a function `IsPatternDetected()` to check if a pattern is detected.
   - The pattern detection logic is implemented here.
   - True is returned if a pattern is detected, and false otherwise.
6. The code defines functions `CalculateEntryPoints()`, `CalculateStopLoss()`, and `CalculateTakeProfit()` to calculate entry points, stop-loss levels, and take-profit levels for each trade.
   - The specific calculation logic is implemented in these functions.
   - The calculated values are returned.
7. The code defines a function `DisplayPatterns()` to display the identified harmonic patterns, entry points, stop-losses, and take-profits.
   - The code to display the patterns and related information is implemented here.
8. The code defines a function `CustomizeSettings()` to allow customization of settings such as timeframes, currency pairs, and pattern parameters.
   - The code for customizing settings is implemented here.
9. The code defines a function `OptimizeCode()` to optimize the code and minimize resource usage.
   - The code optimization logic is implemented here.
10. The code defines a function `HandleErrors()` to handle errors and display error messages or notifications.
    - The code for error handling is implemented here.
11. The main function `OnStart()` is called when the program starts.
    - The series and trade objects are initialized.
    - Patterns are scanned and analyzed.
    - Entry points, stop-losses, and take-profits are calculated for each pattern.
    - Trades are opened using the calculated values.
    - The identified patterns, entry points, stop-losses, and take-profits are displayed.
    - Settings are customized.
    - The code is optimized.
    - Errors are handled.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of how the code works. The actual implementation may involve more complex calculations and logic.
